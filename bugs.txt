<bugs>

- fix the bug that doesnt allow for multiple runs in the json files


<features>

- i want to be able to see how many miles i've done per week, every week

- i want to be able to graph how many of each type (lake, grand, etc) run that i've done, both bar graph and pie graph

- it would be nice to have the historical graph on the same window as the current year

- maybe some automated export of the database

- it would be cool to be able to visually distinguish runs that occur on the same day as separate runs (in the graph)

- hovering over the bar on the graph should reveal the comment for that run

- port the data from 2022 into the database, add a date field aaccordingly

- adding a new run should be a lot easier, no manually editing configs

- editing a run should be a lot easier than it is, no going in and manually updating the sql 

- some way to indicate how many miles per pair of shoe
