Welcome to runner reader!
=========================

Installation
------------
Coming soon


Running
-------

install python

pip install <dependencies> ## this will be automated later

PYTHONPATH=. python src/main.py --interactive --config_file (config path)

NOTE --- in order to use the emailer backup, this project

https://github.com/ZackBotkin/Emailer

will need to be in the python path. I am working on getting everything nice and pip installable

For now, some work will be required on the part of the user to get this up and running locally.

The user can turn the backups off inside the configs.

Configuration
-------------

The config file makes the app more configurable, such as saved runs, the yearly goal, etc.

An example can be found under "example_config"

TODO
