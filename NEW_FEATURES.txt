- some sort of tree view so that I know where in the menu that i am
- standardize the interactive menu so that i can use it in other projects
- monthly stats
- it would be cool if i type "graph bar" for example, it would immediately go into that menu, or like run defaults grand
- some sort of tab complete, it would be great if i could standardize that in the interactive menu
- the top level should be
    "Runs", "All", "Stats", "Routes", "Shoes", "Graphs"
    where runs expands into add/edit/delete
    stats expands into year menu
    routes expands to add/edit/delete

    slight reworking basically

- a script/command that populates the test database for various days
    -- prod --> test copy
