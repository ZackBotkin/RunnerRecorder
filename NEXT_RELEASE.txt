BUGS
- the historical graph doesnt stop on the same date as current year

REFACTOR
- standardize the interactive menu so that i can use it in other projects


FEATURES
- some sort of tree view so that I know where in the menu that i am
- monthly stats
- it would be cool if i type "graph bar" for example, it would immediately go into that menu, or like run defaults grand
- some sort of tab complete, it would be great if i could standardize that in the interactive menu
- the top level should be
    "Runs", "All", "Stats", "Routes", "Shoes", "Graphs"
    where runs expands into add/edit/delete
    stats expands into year menu
    routes expands to add/edit/delete

    slight reworking basically

- a script/command that populates the test database for various days
    -- prod --> test copy

- should have ability to record pain/difficulty after run scale of 1-10
    -- this should then color coat the graph

- i want the ability to do "historical" for every type of graph

- graphs should also have a menu similar to the other stuff, right now it goes back to the main menu after selecting a graph

- there should be more "acceptable" answers for each choice
    -- ie: graphs --> (graph, graphs, chart, charts)
    --     all --> (all, list)
    --     stats --> (stat, stats, data, etc)
    -- this could be customizable via the configs

- should be able to pip install the module and run it very simply, no more downloading the repo and setting the python path... i don't know what's involved in this or if it works like i'm thinking..
