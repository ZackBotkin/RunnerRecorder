<bugs>

- when you enter a route name that the runner does not recognize, then it will immediately say "are you done recording runs" when i would like it to ask for the correct name of the run, or ask the user to enter a new run (or i guess just exit)
- when you are in the routes menu, and do "show", once done it immediately takes you back to the main menu, should take you back to routes menu

<features>

- it would be nice to have the historical graph on the same window as the current year
- maybe some automated export of the database
- it would be cool to be able to visually distinguish runs that occur on the same day as separate runs (in the graph)
- hovering over the bar on the graph should reveal the comment for that run
- port the data from 2022 into the database, add a date field aaccordingly
- some way to indicate how many miles per pair of shoe
- some way to adjust/recalculate the stats dynamically (ie: if my goal was X, my avgs would change by Y)
- the "routes" should not display crazy amounts of decimals, and should have the number of times run for each, should order the routes on number of times run
    -- also display total miles done with each of these


<refactors>

- the json structs that get passed around become classes
- hold the routes in memory, there are several places that i look them up when the function is called
- the graph functions should live in their own class

<done bugs>

<done features>

- i want to be able to graph how many of each type (lake, grand, etc) run that i've done, both bar graph and pie graph
- adding a new route should be a lot easier, no manually editing configs
- editing a run should be a lot easier than it is, no going in and manually updating the sql

<done refactors>
